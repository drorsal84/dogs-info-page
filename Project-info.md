This project is a website i created about Dogs. 

It is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Ajax and Bootstrap 4. 

The website is connected to a dog API called thedogapi.com, and allows the user to search for dog breeds and recieve information about them. 
The search initiates asynchronious calls to the api and renders the recieved information in the website view.
