This project is an informational website I created about Dogs. 

It`s built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Ajax and Bootstrap 4. 

The website is connected to a dog API called thedogapi.com, and allows the user to search for dog breeds and receive information about them. 
The search initiates asynchronous calls to the API and renders the received information in the website view.
